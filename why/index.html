<h2>Why do this?</h2>
Antiwork is a free "job" board for finding open source projects to work on.
<br />
<br />

The name comes from this <a href="https://contributoria.com/issue/2014-12/543d1c2487628e9a6500001b)">article</a>.
<br />
"Antiwork is what we do out of love, fun, interest, talent, enthusiasm,
inspiration, etc. Only a lucky few get paid enough from it to live on, yet it
probably enriches our lives and benefits society more than most jobs do."
<br />
<br />

For a potential contributor finding a new project can be a pain, fixing bugs
isn't so enticing and issues aren't always orientated at those who aren't
familiar. In all, open source software projects are never really sold 
to the newcomer.
<br />
<br />

For a project owner, the churn rate for contributors can be extreme often
resulting in a precious few remaining to be the sole maintainers. The 'new blood'
comes in the form of power users with single issue projects or fixes for minor
irritations. A lone maintainer is never going to be capable of performing
outreach on the level Mozilla can.
<br />
<br />

Antiwork is designed to cost as little as possible, hopefully zero, with as 
little maintence as possible. There is no proper backend here, just github
pages and jekyll.

<h2>About me</h2>
I'm Stefan, a 20 something software engineer based in Berlin. My background is in
large scale C++ development and now covers the web. I'm always interested in
hearing about new projects, open source or not, but I'm only really interested
in working with people who test test test.

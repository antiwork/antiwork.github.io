Antiwork
=========

Antiwork is a free "job" board for finding open source projects to work on.

The name comes from this [article](https://contributoria.com/issue/2014-12/543d1c2487628e9a6500001b).

"Antiwork is what we do out of love, fun, interest, talent, enthusiasm,
inspiration, etc. Only a lucky few get paid enough from it to live on, yet it
probably enriches our lives and benefits society more than most jobs do."


Why?
---

For a potential contributor finding a new project can be a pain, fixing bugs
isn't so enticing and issues aren't always orientated at those who aren't
familiar. In all, open source software projects are never really sold 
to the newcomer.


For a project owner, the churn rate for contributors can be extreme often
resulting in the original authors being the sole maintainers. The 'new blood'
comes in the form of power users with single issue projects or fixes for minor
irritations. A lone maintainer is never going to be capable of performing
outreach on the level Mozilla can.

Antiwork is designed to cost me as little as possible, hopefully zero, with as 
little maintence as possible. There is no backend, just github pages and jekyll.


How do I add a "job"?
---

To keep spammers out and costs down, new jobs are added using pull requests.
Please refer to the add/ page for further instructions.


TODO

Adminbot
Create some github webhooks for handling new pull requests, lint new posts and
automatically accept those from whitelisted projects. Prune old posts, notify posters.



### Credits

All the credits go to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Jekyll-DB](https://github.com/rypan/jekyll-db), [ListJS](http://listjs.com/) + [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I just pulled the pieces together too.

We need to get existing FOSS projects to advertise positions on this site and so encourage potential contributors to visit.

You could start by finding 3-5 potential projects either through github, mailing lists or through various meetup groups you’re a part of. Help identify current weaknesses in respect to the project ambitions and the current makeup of the team, politely suggest antiwork as a route to further the project thereby bringing them onboard.

Make sure to put across that at no point does antiwork ask for money.

If you’re enthusiastic about helping a new project grow and you’re looking to gain experience in this area then it’d be great to have you onboard.

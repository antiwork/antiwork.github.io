The site at the moment needs polishing. There isn't really a logo or a even a colour scheme and we're using bootstrap, which is sufficient for getting off the ground but isn't for the long term.

> **Requirements:**

> - Good working knowledge of HTML & CSS
> - Ability to write high-performance, quality UI code
> - Practical knowledge and experience of jQuery and vanilla JS
> - Frameworks like backbone.js, AngularJS or React...
> - Mobile / responsive design knowledge is a plus
